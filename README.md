##*How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*
>
**Over the many past several years, the main bank’s customers have been unhappy about the quality, timeliness and cost of the lending services provided by the major and the minor banks in Australia. Their frustration and anger arise out of experiences dealing with the banks for business lending. The main causes for this dissatisfaction are due to:
1. Lengthy application forms and other related verifications.
2. ong delays in getting loan approval and then disbursements.
3. Dealing with different people in the bank for one purpose
4. One arm of the bank not knowing what the other arm does and so this results in customers repeating themselves all over again to different bank employees.
5. Long delays and queues in telephone customer service
6. Branch closures result in more queueing at the operating branches and this causegs more frustration
7. Clerical errors at different levels – at the level of broker, bank’s application input team, assessment team and settlement team. These often end up in delayed settlement, thereby causing extreme stress and monetary losses for the customers**

**In order to overcome the above shortfalls in bank dealings, the founders of Prospa Group Limited decided to set up a completely online system of processing business loans for small businesses which would make the applications process very simple, the loan assessment fast and error free and disbursement of funds within a very short period**

##*How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*
>
**Prospa has raised a total of AUD 96.7M in funding over 6 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Jan 1, 2021 from a Post-IPO Equity round. The fundings over a period of about 8 years have been made through Series A and B issues, Loan funding and IPO equity issue**

## Business Activities:

### *What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*
**The company Prospa is using technology to cut down the processing time for processing business loans. Banks traditionally are taking anywhere between 4 to 6 weeks to process and approve loans. Prospa can provide an approval in 2 hours of an application being submitted and funds disbursements could take place in 24 hours’ time 
This would be attractive to the younger generation of business clients who would not like to wait for long time to get their finances in place.**

 ###*Who is the company's intended customer?*

**Any small business customer looking for finance to assist in their operation, would be a potential customer for Prospa. Youth to middle aged business persons who are comfortable with technology and who want to get their business financing in a faster way are the potential clients**

###*Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*
**In 2015, a world market leader called On Deck entered the Australian business lending market and estimated the value of the market to be AUD 91 billion. However there have been various numbers thrown in to estimate this amount, since. On Deck has originated about AUD 13 million till recently but Credit Suisse has provided a AUD 75 million facility for the Australian market, which shows that the market is quite bigger than anticipated. Another player in the fray, Firstmac has a loan book of AUD 12 million. One could safely estimate to be worth atleast AUD 50 billion**


###*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?*
-	**Five years of business lending experience, surviving through the pandemic
-	Founder directors are ex bankers or ex big financial institutions. Their combined skills and experiences are very useful for the effective operation.
-	The company has a leaner and smarter operating structure which makes it very profitable**

###* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)*
**I could not find much info from the Prospa company’s engineering blog. However out of my own thinking the following two measures must be built into the technology used by the company:
1.Usage of VPN to restrict access to the authorised users and also to encrypt any communications within the company.
2. Restricting the staff to use only the company certified mobile devices for the company work**

## Landscape:

### *What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*- **Lending**

###*What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?*

 **1. Drastic reduction of the amount of paperwork required for loan application
  2. All paperwork are electronic. Customers can use their home computer, laptop, tablets or smartphones
  3. The KYC documents like Driver Licence, Medicare card etc could also be uploaded electronically instead of the need to go to a bank branch
  4. Applications will take about 10 minutes to complete
  5. Income verification docs could also be uploaded electronically
  6. The credit approval or otherwise can be processed within 2 hours
  7. Loan funds can be settled within 24 hours
  8. The competition amongst the online lenders is not only about interest rates and other lending terms, but it’s also about the ease of the lending process and the time taken to complete. 
Prospa, clearly stands as a leader in these criteria**

###*What are the other major companies in this domain?*
 **1. On Deck Australia
  2.  Firstmac
     3. Paypal
     4. Lumi
     5. Bizcap**


## Results

###*What has been the business impact of this company so far?*
  **As per the ASX report submitted by the company for the half year ended 31 Dec 2022 
i)	$ 426 million of originations achieved underpinned by strong demands from Australia and New Zealand. This represents a 35% increase on the results of the previous six months.
ii)	Prospa continues to dynamically manage approvals within the risk appetite. The company has the tools and ability to continually serve demand whilst managing arrears.
iii)	There has been a significant growth in the operating cashflow reflecting the high cash profitability of the business. [Source]( https://investor.prospa.com/investor-centre/)**

###*What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?*
  **i) Funding availability: Prospa has $ 1 billion of available limited recourse facilities as at Dec 2022
  ii) Provision of non-lending products: Prospa leads in this as it provides Transaction account, Visa business debit card, Apple Pay, Google pay etc
  iii) Loan book size: This was $ 855.8 million as at end of Dec 2022. Though this is smaller compared to some of the bigger players in the market, Prospa’s rate of growth is impressive and the company will work towards capturing a bigger slice of the market

###*How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?*
**As stated above, in terms of revenue and size of loan book, Prospa is behind some of the bigger players in the market. However with its planned strategy and product offerings and expansion plans, the company hopes to better its position very soon**


## Recommendations

###* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*
**I would advise the company directors to consider a kind of vertical integration by introducing asset finance for businesses including vehicle finance. The company is already planning to embark on adding business credit cards and expense management software. This is definitely a good move. All these initiatives will provide a type of “whole of wallet” service to small and medium business and make them more stickier to the company**

###* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*
**As stated above by offering multiple services which are related to the needs of the business customers, they have the convenience of looking to a one entity for all their needs. From the company’s perspective, this initiative will make the customers stay longer with the company**

###* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*
**Predominantly the existing technologies will be used. Some modifications with regards to links to Service centres in each state for vehicle registration verifications would be required. Also appropriate KYC requirements for credit card issuance need to be built in. However this could be a minor modification of the KYC requirements for business loans**

###* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*
**These modified technologies are a must to integrate these verticals into the existing businesses. Without them, the additional services cannot be provided correctly**
